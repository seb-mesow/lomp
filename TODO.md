# TODO list


## High Priority

- [ ] ensure, that running and debugging tests in VS Code works
- [ ] continous integration (automated testing)
- [ ] multiplication
- [ ] division
- [ ] square root with Karabusta? Square Root Algorithm
- [ ] square

## Medium Priority

- [ ] combined assignments (`+=` `<<=` `*=` ...)
- [ ] create an `mpz` of a string of digits in a certain or arbitrary radix (e.g. for base64)
- [ ] convert an `mpz` to a string in an *arbitrary* radix (e.g. for base64)
- [ ] workflow for code coverage
- [ ] build a fast release version with lmacro
- [ ] build an asserting debug version with lmacro
- [ ] badge with the build status

## Low Priority

- [ ] increment/decrement (`++` `--`)
- [ ] pre/post increment/decrement
- [ ] bitwise operators (`&` `|` `~` `XOR` `<==>` `==>`)
- [ ] workflow for static analysis/checking
- [ ] badge with the licence

## Ideas

- [ ] badge with the version number
- [ ] floating point module `mpf`
